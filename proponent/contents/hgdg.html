            <p>To ensure the success and approval of your proposals, it is imperative that you familiarize yourself with the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines (HGDG). These guidelines serve as the foundation for evaluating projects and initiatives within our institution, with a particular focus on gender equality and inclusivity.</p>
            <div class="instructions mt-4">
                <h2>Crucial Steps and Reminders</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Read the HGDG thoroughly:</strong> Before drafting or submitting any proposal, carefully review the Harmonized Gender and Development Guidelines. Understanding these guidelines will not only align your proposal with institutional priorities but also enhance its potential for approval.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incorporate Gender Perspectives:</strong> Integrate gender perspectives into your project design, objectives, methodologies, and expected outcomes. The HGDG emphasizes the importance of promoting gender equality and addressing the specific needs of diverse groups within our community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Address Gender Mainstreaming:</strong> Ensure that your proposal incorporates gender mainstreaming principles. This involves analyzing the differential impacts of your project on various genders and actively working to minimize gender inequalities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Highlight Gender-Sensitive Indicators:</strong> When outlining project indicators and evaluation criteria, prioritize those that are gender-sensitive. This demonstrates a commitment to assessing the project's impact through a gender lens and contributes to more accurate monitoring and evaluation.</li>
                    <li><strong>Submit with Confidence:</strong> Once you have aligned your proposal with the HGDG and integrated gender considerations effectively, submit your proposal with confidence. Your thorough understanding and application of these guidelines will significantly enhance your proposal's approval rate.</li>
                </ol>
